<h1 style="color: gold;">Epilepsy facts</h1>
<ul>
<li style="color: gold;">DON'T restrain someone having a seizure. Most seizures end in seconds or a few minutes and will end on their own. You can protect the person from injury by following simple first aid steps.<li>
<li style="color: gold;">Epilepsy is NOT contagious. You simply can't catch epilepsy from another person.</li>
<li style="color: gold;">Even with today's medication, epilepsy CANNOT be cured. Epilepsy is a chronic medical problem that for many people can be successfully treated. Unfortunately, treatment doesn't work for everyone. AT LEAST 1 million people in the United States have uncontrolled epilepsy. There is still an urgent need for more research, better treatments, and a cure.</li>
